<h2>Hello world!</h2>
<h2><a href="https://blog.naver.com/dmwls315">It is Eun Jin's Website.
</a>
</h2>
 I'm a business administration student.
<strong>I've just been interested in coding.</strong> <br>Do you want to know why?
<br>When I was a freshman, I took a coding class. It was not my spontaneous attempt.
<br>The course was a first-year required course. I got a B on the test.
<br>Until then, coding was fun but not really interesting.

<p><strong>However there is always turing points.</strong>
 <br>By the time I was a sophomore, <strong>I realized that other people were feeling the discomfort I felt in my daily life.</strong>
 <br><strong><u>So I decided to solve the problem.</u></strong>
 <br><strong><u>In order to do that, I must have to study coding.</strong></u>
 <br>I'll tell you what kind of project it is. Don't be too disappointed.
 <br>It takes time for everyone to get ready, doesn't it?</p>

<p><strong>The goal of this page is a kind of studio for me to learn how to enjoy and utilize coding.</strong>
  <br>I am going to post here an article that outlines my daily life or field of interest.
  <br>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
